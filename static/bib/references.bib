Our ﬁnding is that when properly calculated, the average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not −0.1 percent as published in Reinhart and Rogoﬀ. That is, contrary to RR, average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically diﬀerent than when debt/GDP ratios are lower.},

	abstract = {Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, displaying, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.
See glossary of probability and statistics.
When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.
Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.
A standard statistical procedure involves the test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: Type I errors (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive") and Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false negative"). Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework: ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis.Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also occur. The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.
Statistics can be said to have begun in ancient civilization, going back at least to the 5th century BC, but it was not until the 18th century that it started to draw more heavily from calculus and probability theory. In more recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software to produce tests such as descriptive analysis.},

	abstract = {Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Data science is the same concept as data mining and big data: "use the most powerful hardware, the most powerful programming systems, and the most efficient algorithms to solve problems".Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge. In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.In 2012, when Harvard Business Review called it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century", the term "data science" became a buzzword.  It is now often used interchangeably with earlier concepts like business analytics, business intelligence, predictive modeling, and statistics.  Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was paraphrasing Hans Rosling, featured in a 2011 BBC documentary with the quote, "Statistics is now the sexiest subject around." Nate Silver referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics. In many cases, earlier approaches and solutions are now simply rebranded as "data science" to be more attractive, which can cause the term to become "dilute[d] beyond usefulness." While many university programs now offer a data science degree, there exists no consensus on a definition or suitable curriculum contents. To its discredit, however, many data-science and big-data projects fail to deliver useful results, often as a result of poor management and utilization of resources.},

	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2927479/},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2393-10-37},
	abstract = {Background
Greater epidemiologic understanding of the relationships among fetal-infant mortality and its prognostic factors, including birthweight, could have vast public health implications. A key step toward that understanding is a realistic and tractable framework for analyzing birthweight distributions and fetal-infant mortality. The present paper is the first of a two-part series that introduces such a framework.
Methods
We propose describing a birthweight distribution via a normal mixture model in which the number of components is determined from the data using a model selection criterion rather than fixed a priori.
Results
We address a number of methodological issues, including how the number of components selected depends on the sample size, how the choice of model selection criterion influences the results, and how estimates of mixture model parameters based on multiple samples from the same population can be combined to produce confidence intervals. As an illustration, we find that a 4-component normal mixture model reasonably describes the birthweight distribution for a population of white singleton infants born to heavily smoking mothers. We also compare this 4-component normal mixture model to two competitors from the existing literature: a contaminated normal model and a 2-component normal mixture model. In a second illustration, we discover that a 6-component normal mixture model may be more appropriate than a 4-component normal mixture model for a general population of black singletons.
Conclusions
The framework developed in this paper avoids assuming the existence of an interval of birthweights over which there are no compromised pregnancies and does not constrain birthweights within compromised pregnancies to be normally distributed. Thus, the present framework can reveal heterogeneity in birthweight that is undetectable via a contaminated normal model or a 2-component normal mixture model.},

	abstract = {Reports of successful applications of machine learning (ML) methods in structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) are increasing. ML methods such as convolutional neural networks show promising results and often outperform traditional methods such as empirical scoring functions in retrospective validation. However, trained ML models are often treated as black boxes and are not straightforwardly interpretable. In most cases, it is unknown which features in the data are decisive and whether a model’s predictions are right for the right reason. Hence, we re-evaluated three widely used benchmark data sets in the context of ML methods and came to the conclusion that not every benchmark data set is suitable. Moreover, we demonstrate on two examples from current literature that bias is learned implicitly and unnoticed from standard benchmarks. On the basis of these results, we conclude that there is a need for eligible validation experiments and benchmark data sets suited to ML for more bias-controlled validation in ML-based SBVS. Therefore, we provide guidelines for setting up validation experiments and give a perspective on how new data sets could be generated.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis of textual content is widely used for automatic summarization of opinions and sentiments expressed by people. With the growing popularity of social media and user-generated content, efficient and effective sentiment analysis is critical to businesses and governments. Lexicon-based methods provide efficiency through their manually developed affective word lists and valence values. However, the predictions of such methods can be biased towards positive or negative polarity thus distorting the analysis. In this paper, we propose Bias-Aware Thresholding (BAT), an approach that can be combined with any lexicon-based method to make it bias-aware. BAT is motivated from cost-sensitive learning where the prediction threshold is changed to reduce prediction error bias. We formally define bias in polarity predictions and present a measure for quantifying it. We evaluate BAT in combination with AFINN and SentiStrength -- two popular lexicon-based methods -- on seven real-world datasets. The results show that bias reduces smoothly with an increase in the absolute value of the threshold, and accuracy increases as well in most cases. We demonstrate that the threshold can be learned reliably from a very small number of labeled examples, and supervised classifiers learned on such small datasets produce poorer bias and accuracy performances.},

Although NLP models have shown success in modeling various applications, they propagate and may even amplify gender bias found in text corpora. While the study of bias in artificial intelligence is not new, methods to mitigate gender bias in NLP are relatively nascent. In this paper, we review contemporary studies on recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP. We discuss gender bias based on four forms of representation bias and analyze methods recognizing gender bias. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of existing gender debiasing methods. Finally, we discuss future studies for recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP.},

	abstract = {The great-circle distance or orthodromic distance is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, measured along the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight line through the sphere's interior). The distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of a straight line between them, but on the sphere there are no straight lines. In spaces with curvature, straight lines are replaced by geodesics. Geodesics on the sphere are circles on the sphere whose centers coincide with the center of the sphere, and are called great circles.
The determination of the great-circle distance is part of the more general problem of great-circle navigation, which also computes the azimuths at the end points and intermediate way-points.
Through any two points on a sphere that are not directly opposite each other, there is a unique great circle. The two points separate the great circle into two arcs. The length of the shorter arc is the great-circle distance between the points. A great circle endowed with such a distance is called a Riemannian circle in Riemannian geometry.
Between two points that are directly opposite each other, called antipodal points, there are infinitely many great circles, and all great circle arcs between antipodal points have a length of half the circumference of the circle, or
        π
        r
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}pi r\}
  , where r is the radius of the sphere.
The Earth is nearly spherical (see Earth radius), so great-circle distance formulas give the distance between points on the surface of the Earth correct to within about 0.5\%. (See Arc length § Arcs of great circles on the Earth.)},

	abstract = {Here is a scatter plot with the coordinate labels deliberately omitted. Figure 1. Do you see any trends? How would you model these data? It just so happens that this scatterplot is arguably the most famous scatterplot in history. One aficionado, writing more than forty years after its publication, commented skeptically [1]:"[The] data points were consequently spread all over the [x-y] plot. Nevertheless, he was somehow able to deduce a 'roughly linear' relation between them."There's a hint: a linear fit. "What's the big deal?" you ask. "Isn't that the sort of obvious modeling assumption any statistician, worth his or her salt, would make?" Good point but these ain't just any old data. These data contain the mind of God, as an Einstein or Hawking might say.To see this, let's label the coordinates and do a linear fit through the origin. Figure 2. Now you know. Figure 2 shows the data that Edwin Hubble used in 1929 to deduce that there was a simple linear relationship between the radial distance to a galaxy (x-axis) and the speed with which it is moving relative to us (y-axis). It says that the further away it is, the faster it seems to be moving. For calibration, a Megaparsec (Mpc) is about 3 million light years. The slope of the line corresponds to Hubble's constant, H0 = 423.94 km.s-1.Mpc-1 in Figure 2. The units don't matter too much for our discussion.Today, it's difficult to appreciate the impact of this conclusion. In 1929, it was only just being realized that the universe extended beyond our own Milky Way galaxy. Today, we know that the Milky Way is a mere speck in the vastness of the universe. Also, the Big Bang theory was a very new idea and had to compete with other theories like the Steady State model. The point is, if you claimed a linear relationship in 1929, you were saying something very profound about the structure of the universe so, you'd better have your ducks lined up. Hubble worked pretty hard at herding ducks. How do I know that? Because here's the plot that appears in Hubble's 1929 paper (see Figure 1). Figure 3. You can see immediately that these data points are more tightly clustered around the line of best fit than the data points in Figure 2. There are actually two lines in Figure 3 because Hubble used two different aggregations of his data to further support his conclusions, but that need not concern us here. The important difference is that my Figure 2 comes from simply plotting the distance-velocity (r,v) data in Table 1 of Hubble's paper and it clearly doesn't match his improved Figure 3. Was Hubble stacking his data?The telescopes used by Hubble are located on Earth, which is part of the solar system of planets. Hubble knew that the solar system is also moving through space relative to the stars. Think of our solar system as being like a car going down the highway. When looking at scenery out of the car window, closer objects in the scene, e.g., signage, cows, etc., appear to move past us more rapidly than the more distant mountains. Similarly with the apparent motion of the stars or galaxies, except that motion in space is 3-dimensional (x,y,z) rather than primarily 2-dimensional (x,y) on a highway. Put differently, the bigger the angle we move through relative to the object, the more it appears to move. Hubble took this angular effect into account with the three additional X, Y, Z terms in his linear model: r K + X cos(α) cos(δ) + Y sin (α) cos(δ) + Z sin(δ) = v  which is unnumbered and appears about half way between Table 1 and Table 2 in his paper.The factor K is his notation for H0. Hubble didn't provide the extra angular-motion data in his paper, but if you're an astronomer, you can determine it. I'm not an astronomer but Prof. Ned Wright at UCLA is, and he kindly provided me with those additional data so that I was able to apply the angular corrections to Table 1 and reproduce Hubble's Figure 3. Here's the R script that does all the tedious work.hub},

	abstract = {Data wrangling is a critical foundation of data science, and wrangling of categorical data is an important component of this process. However, categorical data can introduce unique issues in data wrangling, particularly in real-world settings with collaborators and periodically-updated dynamic data. This paper discusses common problems arising from categorical variable transformations in R, demonstrates the use of factors, and suggests approaches to address data wrangling challenges. For each problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in base R and the other from the ‘tidyverse.’ We consider several motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality and sound analysis.},

	abstract = {Racial bias in predictive policing algorithms has been the focus of a number of recent news articles, statements of concern by several national organizations (e.g., the ACLU and NAACP), and simulation-based research. There is reasonable concern that predictive algorithms encourage directed police patrols to target minority communities with discriminatory consequences for minority individuals. However, to date there have been no empirical studies on the bias of predictive algorithms used for police patrol. Here, we test for such biases using arrest data from the Los Angeles predictive policing experiments. We find that there were no significant differences in the proportion of arrests by racial-ethnic group between control and treatment conditions. We find that the total numbers of arrests at the division level declined or remained unchanged during predictive policing deployments. Arrests were numerically higher at the algorithmically predicted locations. When adjusted for the higher overall crime rate at algorithmically predicted locations, however, arrests were lower or unchanged.},

Assuming data about the predictor, target, and membership in the protected group are available, we show how to optimally adjust any learned predictor so as to remove discrimination according to our deﬁnition. Our framework also improves incentives by shifting the cost of poor classiﬁcation from disadvantaged groups to the decision maker, who can respond by improving the classiﬁcation accuracy.},

	title = {4 ways to be more productive, using {RStudio}’s terminal},
	url = {https://www.r-bloggers.com/4-ways-to-be-more-productive-using-rstudios-terminal-2/},
	abstract = {Introduction RStudio version 1.1 introduced the Terminal functionality, which does not seem to be getting enough deserved attention and love even though it is very well integrated with the rest of the IDE and can be extremely useful for several daily use-cases.  In this post we will try to cover 4 very common scenarios where the Terminal can be very useful and productive, and how to get the most of it.   RStudio Terminal Fun  In short, the RStudio Terminal provides access to the system shell directly from the RStudio IDE, supporting xterm emulation, full-screen terminal applications, command line operations and more. It also has useful customizable keyboard shortcut bindings to make frequent usage more efficient and enables usage of multiple such Terminals simultaneously. The experience may vary based on each user’s setup, this experience comes mostly from using RStudio server on a Linux-based system.   Four common use-cases  1. Execute resource-heavy R code in the Terminal quickly A very common use case where the Terminal makes my life a lot easier is when I need to execute a longer running or resource-heavy tasks in R. Using the RStudio IDE’s session for such tasks can be challenging because running them can slow the entire IDE down, sometimes even so much that it is barely usable. We can easily prevent this by running such tasks in a separate R process within the Terminal. We could of course do this using putty or other software, however doing it within RStudio brings  seamless keyboard shortcut integration between the editor window and the Terminal ability to use multiple Terminals easily no need to use other software  To run commands in the terminal, we simply press:   Shift + Alt + R to open a new terminal launch R in the Terminal  Ctrl + 1 to focus back to the editor window  Ctrl + Alt + Enter to send commands to be executed directly to the Terminal  We can also do this with multiple Terminals if we need to run multiple such “jobs”, and easily switch between Terminal windows using keyboard shortcuts   Ctrl + Alt + F11 - Previous terminal  Ctrl + Alt + F12 - Next terminal  Note the shortcuts mentioned above are default and more than likely not Mac-relevant, but you can easily find those as well in case you are a Mac user, and change them to your liking as well.   2. Advanced version control directly within RStudio RStudio has a neat version control integration which is a very nice addition to the IDE, however there are some advanced version control operations that are not possible to handle there directly, git rebase and git push --force being just a couple of examples. Thanks to the Terminal, you can very easily do all those operations without ever leaving your RStudio IDE.   3. Serving your Shiny app/Blogdown site without blocking or slowdown My favourite use of the Terminal when writing this blog is to serve the site via the Terminal and see the changes I make live, without the IDE being slowed down and laggy, which often happens when serving the site directly from RStudio’s R session. A very similar point also applies when running a Shiny app from within RStudio. This simple use of the Terminal makes things more convenient for me. Running a Shiny app. We can use a pre-selected port to make viewing later easier: \# Send to the terminal with Ctrl + Alt + Enter: R -e 'library(shiny); runApp("appdir", port = 9999, launch.browser = FALSE)' \# Then show in the viewer with Ctrl + Enter rstudioapi::viewer("http://127.0.0.1:9999") Similarly, serving a Blogdown site: \# Send to the terminal with Ctrl + Alt + Enter: R -e 'library(blogdown); blogdown::serve\_site(port = 9999, browser = FALSE)' \# Then show in the viewer with Ctrl + Enter rstudioapi::viewer("http://127.0.0.1:9999") Alternatively, we can also use rstudioapi to send commands to the Terminal: termId  Global Options... -\_\_ Terminal  The Terminal can be interfaced with using the rstudioapi package functionality.
