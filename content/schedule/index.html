<li><a href="/Assignment/Reading/"><strong>Reading</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains the readings you are expected to read between Monday’s lecture and Thursday’s lab</li>
<li><a href="/Assignment/Lab"><strong>Lab</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains the group lab assignments that will be started and hopefully finished during the Thursday in-class coding lab. Labs will be worked on in groups of 2-3 and turned in the latest on Friday at 11:59 PM EST. Labwork is pass/fail.</li>
<li><a href="/assignment/homework"><strong>Homework</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for each of the larger assignments. <strong>Assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the day they’re listed.</strong> Assignments are expected to be original work, not conducted in pairs.</li>
