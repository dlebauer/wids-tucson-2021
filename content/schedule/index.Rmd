Here's your roadmap for the semester!

- [**Lecture**](/Lecture/) (<i class="fas fa-users"></i>): This page contains the handouts, slides, live-written code, and (maybe) the recorded lectures for the topic.
- [**Reading**](/Assignment/Reading/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains the readings you are expected to read between Monday's lecture and Thursday's lab
- [**Lab**](/Assignment/Lab) (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains the group lab assignments that will be started and hopefully finished during the Thursday in-class coding lab. Labs will be worked on in groups of 2-3 and turned in the latest on Friday at 11:59 PM EST. Labwork is pass/fail. 
- [**Homework**](/assignment/homework) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for each of the larger assignments. **Assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the day they're listed.** Assignments are expected to be original work, not conducted in pairs.
