The main goals of this class are to 

## Lectures
Listen, watch live coding, ask many questions, and learn fundamental data science skills.


## Readings
Take a deeper dive into the topics, learn more about function options and coding practices. Practice in-text coding exercises on your own.


## Labs
Work together to practice writing R code, while helping each other, seeing multiple approaches to a problem, and completing a series of lab exercises. Lab exercises are pass/fail, meaning if you put in a solid effort and complete the majority, you will receive credit. Any questions you find more difficult can be covered in class.

## Homework assignments
Homeworks are individual assignments designed to test your knowledge, critical thinking, and engagement with R code. Many skills we will learn take practice in thinking in different and new ways - homeworks are designed to assess how you skills are aligning with the course learning objectives. Homeworks are expected to be completed on your own and are graded by each individual question. 

## Final project

At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your knowledge of data science by completing a final project.

[Complete details for the final project are here.](/assignment/01-final-project/)

At this time, there is no final exam. This project is your final exam. However, if I feel a final exam would help your learning, it could be implemented.
