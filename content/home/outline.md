The Global WiDS Conference aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and to support women in the field. This one-day technical conference provides an opportunity to hear about the latest data science related research and applications in a number of domains, and connect with others in the field.

WiDS Tucson is an independent event organized by the University of Arizona to coincide with the annual Global Women in Data Science (WiDS) Conference held at Stanford University and an estimated 150+ locations worldwide. All genders are invited to attend WiDS regional events, which features outstanding women doing outstanding work.

This Tucson WIDS meeting aims to further build the community around women in Data Science. The meeting provides a forum for women to share technical information about their projects with each other, and community members; to explore innovative topics emerging in the software and data infrastructure communities; to discuss and learn about best practices across projects; and to stimulate new ideas of achieving software and data sustainability and new collaborations.

Women in the data science community are invited to present talks and posters on their projects. Anyone who is interested in attending the meeting is welcome and encouraged to do so. There is no registration fee, but participants need to register by the deadline to allow for planning logistics.

This meeting is virtual, and participants are encouraged to move from Zoom meeting to Zoom meeting to maximize their own experience.
